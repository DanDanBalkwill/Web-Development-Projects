<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is my goto movie to sit down and watch anytime, I think it is a really beautiful film.</p>
<h3>Home Alone 1 and 2</h3>
<p>These are together my favourite Christmas movies I love watching every year on Christmas Eve.</p>
<h3>The Shining</h3>
<p>This is quite possibly in my opinion one of the best horror films ever made.</p>
